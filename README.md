# Esunview

From: https://github.com/lipupini/esunview/blob/master/README.md

---

Esunview is a **donationware** [Lipupini](https://github.com/lipupini/lipupini) module for continued development.

The following features are added:

- Ability to purchase downloads.
- Ability to gate an entire folder, where access is granted after a payment.
- The homepage content comes directly from this `README.md`

Nearly all general improvements go to Esunview instead of Lipupini.

Is some part of this repository useful? Contact me with inquiries, tips, or to report the weather in your area. Let me know if there are any questions when setting it up. It is different from Lipupini in that it requires a bit more setup to get started and use.

If you are unable to donate, still reach out.

Use more than one if you can.

The only installation that I am working on right now is at https://c.dup.bz

`c.dup.bz` uses the exact same source code that is in this repository: https://github.com/lipupini/esunview
