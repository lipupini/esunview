`Lukinview` is a frontend module for Lupupini.

The webserver's document root (`webroot`) is contained here. You can symlink it elsewhere.

Using this pattern, things like `favicon.ico`, loaded modules, and the entire frontend can be efficiently customized.

The `c` folder in `webroot` needs to be writeable as it will store cache. This should be performed as the webserver user. If the `c` folder is already there, then it was writeable and this step can be skipped.

```shell
cd module/Lukinview/webroot
mkdir c || chmod 755 c
```

To make a new frontend module, copy this `Lukinview` folder and use your new module folder's `webroot` for your webserver document root instead.

You will need to update `system/config/state.php` to reflect your new frontend module, for example if the name is `Mokuview`:

```php
return new Module\Lipupini\State(
	[...]
	frontendModule: 'Mokuview',
	[...]
);
```
